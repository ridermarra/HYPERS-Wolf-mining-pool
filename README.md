# HyperSound Miner


## Overview
This repository provides a minimal setup to begin mining $HYPERS tokens.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system: 

```Node.js``` and ```npm``` or ```yarn``` ([guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))

## Get started
Follow these steps to set up and run the miner:
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Add the private key of your miner wallet in ```config.js```. For security reasons, itâ€™s recommended to create a new wallet address specifically for mining. Only transfer the funds you wish to use for mining to this address.
3. Adjust the ```MINE_TX_PER_MINUTE``` parameter in ```config.js``` to control the number of mining transactions per minute. Increasing this number improves your chances of being selected as the winner and receiving the miner reward once the block is validated.
4. Run ```npm i``` or ```yarn``` to install the dependencies
5. Run ```node mine.js``` to launch the miner bot

Please note: This example is very basic and will need to be improved to remain competitive over a long period of time.
